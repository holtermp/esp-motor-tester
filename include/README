This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include`.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With the include mechanism, a single copy of the header
file is stored and the exact contents of the header file are included in all
source files that need it.

For Arduino IDE, a header file is just a file with .h extension and needs to be
declared for using it with the include directive.
